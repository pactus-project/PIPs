## Abstract

This proposal enables automatic recovery of used addresses when restoring a wallet from a mnemonic phrase.

## Motivation

### Problem

Right now, when a wallet is recovered using a mnemonic phrase, it cannot restore all previously used or balance-holding addresses.
Users must manually create addresses, which is not efficient.
It can also cause problems, especially if there is a gap in address usage.

### Solution

This proposal suggests recovering addresses that have activity on the blockchain.
An address is considered active if its public key is saved in the blockchain database.
Otherwise, it is inactive or empty.

## Specification

When recovering a wallet from an external source (e.g., mnemonic phrase), the software should follow these steps:

1. Create a temporary in-memory wallet for address recovery.
2. Set `recovered_count = 1`.
3. Set `inactive_count = 1`.
4. Derive the first address.
5. Loop:
   * Check if the addressâ€™s public key is indexed in the blockchain.
   * If **not indexed** (inactive):
      * Increase `inactive_count` by 1.
      * If `inactive_count > 32`, break the loop.
      * Derive the next address.
   * If **indexed** (active):
      * Add `inactive_count` to `recovered_count`.
      * Reset `inactive_count = 1`.
      * Derive the next address.

After finding all recoverable addresses,
the software should delete the temporary in-memory wallet, create a permanent wallet,
and recover addresses based on the total number of recovered addresses.

### Limitation

Users can't **automatically** recover a used address if it is separated by more than 32 inactive or empty addresses.
In this case, the user needs to manually create addresses until they reach the desired one.

## Backward Compatibility

This change is backward-compatible.
