## Abstract

This proposal introduces support for a Batch Transfer payload, enabling a one-to-many scheme for transferring PAC.

## Motivation

Batch transfers allow users to include multiple recipients in a single transfer payload, known as `BatchTransfer`,
which is executed simultaneously.
This functionality is particularly advantageous for users who wish to send PAC to multiple accounts in one transaction.

## Specifications

Currently, transactions in Pactus can include the following payloads:

- Transfer Payload
- Bond Payload
- Unbond Payload
- Withdraw Payload
- Sortition Payload

This PIP proposes the addition of a new payload type: **Batch Transfer**.

The `BatchTransfer` payload will be structured as follows:

| Field               | Type      | Size     | Description                                |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| From                | `Address` | 21 Bytes | Sender's address                           |
| NumberOfRecipients  | `Number`  | Variant  | Number of recipients                       |
| Recipients[].To     | `Address` | 21 Bytes | Receiver's address (within each recipient) |
| Recipients[].Amount | `Amount`  | Variant  | Amount to transfer (within each recipient) |

The Batch Transfer payload will be encoded deterministically.
The number of recipients will be used to decode the recipients.

## Backwards Compatibility

Batch transfers are **not** backward-compatible.
This feature will be activated at block number `4,800,000` on the Mainnet.
Older versions of the software will not be able to decode or process Batch Transfers.

## Security Considerations

The payload will only execute if all recipient addresses are valid and
the total sum of the amounts does not exceed the senderâ€™s available balance.
The number of recipients is capped at 8 to prevent excessively large transactions that could strain network resources.
