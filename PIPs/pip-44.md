## Abstract

Pactus's focus on accessibility, security, and sustainability via SSPoS makes it ripe for innovation.
This proposal introduces a decentralized AI chatbot to simplify wallet operations and DAO governance,
empowering users with natural language commands. By halving validator rewards to fund compute contributors,
it fosters a sustainable ecosystem. A long-term goal allows developers to
deploy WASM-based smart contracts via the chatbot, boosting dApp growth and
positioning Pactus as a leader in AI-blockchain integration.

## Motivation

- Community Empowerment: A DAO aligns with Pactus's decentralized ethos, giving users a voice.
- AI Leadership: Positions Pactus as a pioneer, attracting tech-savvy participants.
- Adoption Growth: Simplifies interactions, potentially increasing users 2-5x.
- Sustainability: Reward adjustments support long-term economic stability.

## Specification

- **Architecture**: Features a frontend AI chatbot (web/mobile with NLP, sharded LLMs like Llama),
  a decentralized compute layer (node runners contribute GPU/CPU, tracked on-chain),
  and blockchain integration (Pactus APIs, PVM).
- **Reward Mechanism Modification**: Reduces validator rewards from 0.7 PAC/block (post-PIP-43) to 0.35 PAC/block,
  allocating 0.35 PAC/block to compute contributors, with the Foundation's 0.3 PAC/block unchanged.
  Rewards are distributed pro-rata based on FLOPs/hashrate, requiring minimal staking to prevent sybils,
  implemented via PIP and tested on testnet.
- **Wallet Functionality**: AI enables address creation, send/receive PAC, staking,
  and balance queries using the consumptional fee model.
- **DAO Governance**: Requires 100 PAC to propose, 10 PAC to vote, with a 1% voting cap (~420,000 PAC) per voter and
  10% staked supply quorum. The Pactus team holds veto power due to execution responsibility,
  ensuring security. DAO proposals can be made and displayed for voting through the chatbot.
- **User Rewards**: Offers 0.001-0.01 PAC per interaction from fees/community pool, capped daily.

## Backwards Compatibility

Unsure

## Test Cases

- Test reward halving on testnet to ensure fair distribution.
- Simulate AI-driven wallet operations and DAO voting.

## Reference Implementation

- **AI Chatbot Development**: Uses PyTorch/TensorFlow for federated learning, fine-tuning Llama on wallet ops,
  governance, and WASM syntax. Nodes run WASM-based inference, tracked via
  on-chain proofs (e.g., Merkle proofs of FLOPs). Integrates Pactus JS SDK and gRPC for tx submission.

## Security Considerations

- Risks include reward resistance and low adoption.
- Mitigations: Gradual phasing and marketing via Pactus channels to encourage participation.

2 Proposed Integration: Decentralized AI Chatbot and DAO
2.1 High-Level Concept
The initiative introduces a decentralized AI chatbot as a user-friendly interface for wallet operations
and DAO governance via natural language (e.g., “Send 5 PAC” or “Vote on proposal
X”). Compute is provided by node runners, incentivized through restructured rewards. The
DAO enables PAC holders to propose and vote on upgrades, with team veto and voting caps for
fairness.
