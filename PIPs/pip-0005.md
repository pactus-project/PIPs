## Abstract

adding different prefix to different address types like: `validator` and `account` to have a more understandable address. 

## Motivation

address on `Pactus` have a `pc` prefix, for both validators and accounts. its impossible for humans and difficult for machine to find out address belongs to an `account`, `validator` or a `contract`. with adding suitable prefix we can find out the address role much faster and easier.

## Specification

to have suitable address prefix we can define `3` prefix for current types, `pv` for validators, `pc` for contracts and `pa` for account. all address must have correct prefix to be known as a valid address in `Pactus`.

also the Possible future types must follow this rule and have their own prefix.
