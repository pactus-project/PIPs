## Abstract

adding different prefix to different address types like: `validator` and `account` to have a more understandable address. 

## Motivation

address on `Pactus` have a `pc` prefix, for both validators and accounts. its impossible for humans and difficult for machine to find out address belongs to an `account`, `validator` or a `contract`. with adding suitable prefix we can find out the address role much faster and easier.
For example:
account:   `pa1puc5zza3hnp2tcf6r5n8zz0mwcjhqlxtejnjkzv`
validator: `pv1p8wqgmagsrzn0nr26weg6wekqtu2mc6uw72k04a`
contract:  `pc1pdw5fda6r757q780xvtsxhfls24vekrfqmddqrs`

## Specification

to have suitable address prefix we can define `3` prefix for current types, `pv` for validators, `pc` for contracts and `pa` for account. all address must have correct prefix to be known as a valid address in `Pactus`, and we should consider the version number after the prefix is related to the specific address type. 

also the Possible future types must follow this rule and have their own prefix.
